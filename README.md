# Helmet-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project aimed to develop a predictive model to access the probability of a person wearing a helmet or not in individuals based on YOLO, CNN. This project is used for the generation of a database which consists of synthesized pictures to detect no helmet. It helps to overcome the problems of traffic.
